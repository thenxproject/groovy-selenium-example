# Project setup
1. Clone code from GitHub using IntelliJ
2. Using the terminal, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
    Windows:
   ```cmd
    gradlew.bat build
   ```
    Linux/Mac:
   ```bash
    ./gradlew build
   ```
3. Open the test class DemoTest `CTRL + N` on Windows/Linux or `CMD + O` on Mac will bring to you to the open class screen.
   1. If the file does not show when you type the name into the box go to the Gradle (elephant) icon on the right side of IntelliJ then click the icon in the area that opens that is 2 arrows forming a circle.
4. Run either the whole class or just one of the methods.
5. If you run the whole class it should launch the tests in parallel. So multiple tests will run at the same time.

# Notes
I have a test server at https://selenium-demo.thenxproject.com/ that can be used for experimenting.
